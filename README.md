# Python Levelgrind

Assorted exercises from various courses to help me learn Python!

### Courses I'm currently taking for learning python:

- [The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-python3-bootcamp/)
- [Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/) (More specifically, I'm also doing the Learn Python appendix sections before I relly get started in the main course)
